A tool for smoothing bathymetry in an MPAS-Ocean initial condition with a
Gaussian filter with a characteristic length scale (stdDeviation) and cut-off
distance (distanceLimit). The smoothing is only applied if the original
maxLevelCell is larger than a given threshold (minLevelForSmoothing). Smoothing
is applied over a given number of iterations (numSmoothingPasses).

An example namelist file (smooth_depth_in) is:

&smooth
    filename_depth_in  = "mpaso.IcoswISC30E3r2.20230901.nc"
    filename_depth_out = "smooth.IcoswISC30E3r2.r200e100.1pass.min5.skipLandIce.231115.nc"
    filename_mpas_mesh   = "mpaso.IcoswISC30E3r2.20230901.nc"
    distanceLimit    = 200.
    stdDeviation     = 100.
    numSmoothingPasses = 1
    minLevelForSmoothing = 5
