MPAS-Atmosphere utility for creating regional meshes by projecting a
Cartesian mesh of perfect hexagons to the sphere using standard map
projections

The current implementation uses a rectangular Cartesian mesh, with the
corners slightly rounded, and projects this mesh to the sphere using a
Lambert Conformal projection.  Executing "make" with the included
Makefile produces an executable named "project_hexes".  The inputs
to this executable are given in the ascii file "namelist.projections"
(a standard Fortran namelist file). The inputs variables should be
obvious from their names, and some further information is given in
"Notes" below. The utility produces a netcdf file "mpas_hex_mesh.nc"
describing the regional mesh in the form of a standard MPAS grid file,
with the projection existing on the unit sphere (as is the case with
all MPAS grid files for spheres).  The utility also produces a
graph.info file that serves as input to METIS to produce a partion
file for use by MPAS as described in the MPAS-A Users Guide.

Notes:

The (x,y) extent of the domain is in meters on the earth-radius sphere,
but as noted the MPAS grid file that is produced is on the unit sphere.

Following WRF, the longitudinal center of the project is given by the
namelist parameter "standard_longitude_degrees".  The center of the
projected mesh is given by the namelist parameter
"reference_longitude_degrees".

The hexagons are oriented pointing west-east.

A python script is included that can plot the resulting mesh.
An NCL script (a depricated language) is also provided to plot
the mesh.

The mesh can be moved and rotated to any place on the sphere using
the MPAS grid_rotate tool (see the MPAS Users Guide).
