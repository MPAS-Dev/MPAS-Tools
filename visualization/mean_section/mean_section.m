% function mean_section

% Plot cross-sections of means of MPAS fields.
% 
% This is the main function, where the user can specify data files,
% coordinates and text, then call functions to find sections, load
% data, and plot cross-sections. 
%
% The final product is a set of plots as jpg files, a latex file,
% and a compiled pdf file of the plots, if desired.
