%function transport_sections

% Specify data files, coordinates and text, then call functions
% to find edge sections, load data, and compute transport through
% each section.
%
% This script produces new netcdf files in the subdirectory
% netcdf_files which can then be merged with grid.nc or restart.nc
% files to collect transport data in MPAS-Ocean
%
% To merge the new *_section_edge_data.nc with an existing grid or
% restart file, use:
% ncks -A -v sectionEdgeIndex,sectionEdgeSign,nEdgesInSection,\
% sectionText,sectionAbbreviation,sectionCoord \
% your_file_section_edge_data.nc your_restart_file.nc

% The text string [wd '/' sim(i).dir '/' sim(i).netcdf_file ] is the file path,
% where wd is the working directory and dir is the run directory.

wd = '/var/tmp/mpeterse/runs/';

% These files only need to contain a small number of variables.
% You may need to reduce the file size before copying to a local
% machine using:
% ncks -v avgNormalVelocity, \
% nAverage,latVertex,lonVertex,verticesOnEdge,edgesOnVertex,refLayerThickness,\
% dvEdge \
% file_in.nc file_out.nc
%
% and avgNormalVelocity is only required if the flux is computed by this matlab script.
