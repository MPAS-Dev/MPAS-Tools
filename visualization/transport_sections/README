transport_sections README

This is a matlab tool to find sections that connect two points on the
globe.  These sections are a sequence of connected edges, and the
edges and other variables are output as both a netcdf and text files.
The transport can then be measured using this matlab code using output
files, or in MPAS-Ocean during runtime.

To begin, change the parameters at the top of transport_sections.m.
You will need to change the text strings wd, sim(i).dir, and
sim(i).netcdf_file so that the text string

[wd '/' sim(i).dir '/' sim(i).netcdf_file ] is the file path,

where wd is the working directory and dir is the run directory.
Details of the section coordinates and variables may be specified in
transport_sections.m.

The data files only need to contain a small number of variables.
You may need to reduce the file size before copying to a local
machine using:

ncks -v acc_u, \
nAccumulate,latVertex,lonVertex,verticesOnEdge,edgesOnVertex,hZLevel,\
dvEdge \
file_in.nc file_out.nc

The matlab scripts will create a new netcdf file named
{your_domain}_section_edge_data.nc.  To merge this file with an
existing grid or restart file, use:

ncks -A -v sectionEdgeIndex,sectionEdgeSign,nEdgesInSection,\
sectionText,sectionAbbreviation,sectionCoord \
{your_domain}_section_edge_data.nc your_restart_file.nc

These matlab tools have been tested for ocean output files, but should
nearly work for other cores as well.  A few lines will need to be
changed.
