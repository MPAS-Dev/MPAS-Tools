About:
    This script (update_versions.py) is used to increment version numbers in
    the MPAS Core Registry.xml files.

    It can be run from the root MPAS directory (with the root Makefile).

    It searches the current directory for all files with .xml extensions. Then
    extracts the version number from each of them and increments the
    appropriate version number. Then re-writes the file.

    To script can be run as follows:
        ./update_versions.py [--major] [--minor]

    The --major and --minor flags are optional. If both are omitted, the script
    does nothing.

    The --major flag increments the major version number by 1, and resets the
    minor version number to zero.

    The --minor flag increments the minor version number by 1, and ignores the
    major version number.
