# MPAS Tools

This repository houses all MPAS related tools. These include compiled tools,
and scripts with a variety of purposes. Tools should be sorted into larger
directories based on their purpose. Under each of these directories, a tool
should live in it's own directory.

## Documentation

The latest documentation for the conda package `mpas_tools` can be found here:

[http://mpas-dev.github.io/MPAS-Tools/master/](http://mpas-dev.github.io/MPAS-Tools/master/)

Many tools are not in the conda package, and documentation (sometimes fairly
limited) is available at the beginning of each script.

**Note**: as of Sep 2025, [@xylar](https://github.com/xylar/) who has been the main maintainer of the conda package will no longer be working on the project. As a result updates to the `mpas_tools` conda package may be limited after that date.
