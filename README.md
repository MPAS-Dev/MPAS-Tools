# MPAS Tools

This repository houses all MPAS related tools. These include compiled tools,
and scripts with a variety of purposes. Tools should be sorted into larger
directories based on their purpose. Under each of these directories, a tool
should live in it's own directory.

## Documentation

The latest documentation for the conda package `mpas_tools` can be found here:

[http://mpas-dev.github.io/MPAS-Tools/master/](http://mpas-dev.github.io/MPAS-Tools/master/)

Many tools are not in the conda package, and documentation (sometimes fairly
limited) is available at the beginning of each script.
