# MPAS Tools

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MPAS-Dev/MPAS-Tools.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MPAS-Dev/MPAS-Tools)

This repository houses all MPAS related tools. These include compiled tools,
and scripts with a variety of purposes. Tools should be sorted into larger
directories based on their purpose. Under each of these directories, a tool
should live in it's own directory.

## Documentation

The latest documentation for the conda package `mpas-tools` can be found here:

[http://mpas-dev.github.io/MPAS-Tools/stable/](http://mpas-dev.github.io/MPAS-Tools/stable/)

Many tools are not in the conda package, and documentation (sometimes fairly
limited) is available at the beginning of each script.
